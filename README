1.In the main.py file, I created 2 functions. The "get_coindesk_data" function is getting the data from the API in json
format and returns it.
2.The "insert_data_into_database" function is given the json response from the previous function as a parameter.
If there is not a created database, the function creates it, retrieves the needed currency and price metrics that are
needed and inserts them into the database table. This function is called after if statement "if __name__=="__main__",
because that way when you run the unittest it's not created a new database just for the test.
3. The "TestGetCoindeskData" is testing the functionality with mocked data.
